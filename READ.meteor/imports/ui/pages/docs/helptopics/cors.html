<h3>CORS</h3>
<blockquote>
  CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. There are situations when READ attempts to access a REST end-point
  through the browser / front-end mechanisms, but the access fails since the REST service is not configured for
  cross-origin data transfers. The following steps provide a possible workaround in these situations.

<h4>CORS Proxying</h4>
<ul class="list-group">
  <li class="list-group-item">Install <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">NodeJS</a>.
    Commands <code>node</code> and <code>npm</code> will work if NodeJS is installed.
  </li>
  <li class="list-group-item">
    <code>cd streamsx.visualization/READ.meteor</code>
  </li>
  <li class="list-group-item">
    <code>node_modules/corsproxy/bin/corsproxy</code>
  </li>
  <li class="list-group-item">The above command should start the CORS proxy at port 1337. Get the <strong>public</strong> IP
    address for your machine; say 8.74.12.82.
    While creating a READ data set with another URL, say http://my.domain.com:2912/path/to/resource,
    use the following proxied URL instead: http://8.74.12.32:1337/my.domain.com:2912/path/to/resource
  </li>
  <li class="list-group-item"> It is important that you use the <strong>public</strong> IP address as the
    URL prefix while CORS proxying. Otherwise, if you use http://localhost:1337/my.domain.com:2912/path/to/resource
    instead, it is possible that you will be able to access the data during development, but your end-users may not
    be able to access the data while viewing your shared dashboards.
  </li>
</ul>
