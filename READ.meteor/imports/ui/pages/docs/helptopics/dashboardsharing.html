<h3>Dashboard Sharing</h3>
<ul class="list-group">
  <li class="list-group-item"> Make your READ app public (uncheck private in the apps tab).</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">
    Provide the <strong>public</strong> URL of your READ.Sharing service. http://localhost:3002 is bad.
    Lets say 8.74.12.82 is the <strong>public</strong> IP of the machine where you started the READ.share service.
    http://8.74.12.82:3002 is good.
  </li>
  <li class="list-group-item">
    Use the public link for app generated by READ to share your READ app.
  </li>
</ul>
