    Use a <em>public facing IP address</em> for your READ.share service.
    For example, suppose 8.74.12.82 is the <strong>public facing</strong> IP of the machine the READ.share service
    will run. Start your READ.share service using the command
    <code>meteor --port 8.74.12.82:3002</code>. Do not use http://localhost:3002.

  <li class="list-group-item">
    In the apps tab for your app, within the field labeled <strong>READ.Sharing service URL</strong>, enter
    the URL where the READ.share service is running (http://8.74.12.82:3002 in our example) and
