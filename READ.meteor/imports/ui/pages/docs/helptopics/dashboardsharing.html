<h3>Sharing READ Dashboards</h3>
<h5>Follow these steps to make your READ app and dashboards publicly accessible.</h5>
<ul class="list-group">
  <li class="list-group-item"> Navigate to the <code>streamsx.visualization/READ.share</code> folder in a
    terminal. <code>export MONGO_URL="mongodb://localhost:3001/meteor"</code>.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item"> Find the public facing IP address for your machine (for example, using the <code>ifconfig</code> command
    if you are working on a mac or linux). Suppose 8.74.12.82 is the <strong>public facing</strong> IP of the machine.
    In the same terminal as above, <code>meteor --port 8.74.12.82:3002</code>.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item"> Uncheck the private button for your app in the apps tab.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">
    In the apps tab for your app, within the field labeled <strong>READ.Sharing service URL</strong>, enter
    the URL where the READ.share service is running (http://8.74.12.82:3002 in our example).
